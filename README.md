# *Speedy*: A Digital Exercise Log

 *Speedy* is a Java based exercise diary used to log runs, cycling and swimming data. Athletes will be able to add 
 workout statistics like distance, duration, speed, and average heart rate. This will allow users to track their 
 workouts over time and see improvements in their fitness. This project is of interest to me
because I am a runner and I enjoy being able to track my progress in my favourite sport.
